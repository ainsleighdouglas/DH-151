# Thinking Cap

### Response
Over the past few digital humanities courses I feel like I have gotten a stronger hold on the creative process in UX/UI design, like heuristic research. However, an interesting new tool that I learned through the reading was the UX pyramid. I think the interesting idea behind this was what is necessary and what is "additional". I wouldnt go as far as to say the top of the pyramid is unnecassary but it is the line that makes a different between pro and novice. 

### Questions
What is the collaboration process like on a team with multiple disciplines? how roles like visual designer and user researcher overlap during the creation process?
