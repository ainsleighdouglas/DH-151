		<p>I was a competitive synchronized swimmer for 10 years and it has taken me all over the US! Here I have documented the cities I’ve been to as a part of those travels. Additionally I have added locations for professional synchronized swimming shows that I have done while in college.
			<br></br>
			Top 3 favorite locations:
			<ul>
				<li>Olympic Training Center Colorado Springs (competitive)</li>
                <li>Hearst Castle (professional)</li>
                <li>New York (competitive)</li>
