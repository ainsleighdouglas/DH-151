* What are your thoughts on "thick mapping in the digital humanities," and how does it differ from "mapping?"

Thick mapping is the idea that maps can represent a 3 dimensional concept in contrary to the 2D ideas of traditional mapping. When you look a thick map you should be able to grasp the how, why, when and where not just the where. It also stretches the idea that once a map has been made it is then stagnant or set in stone, it instead encourages thee idea that information on maps are always changing or being updated. Thick mapping seems to be away to conquer bias that appears when visualizing data, it in a way shows multiple perspectives on a subject.

* How does the theory of "thick mapping" inform narratives that are influencing your life?

Thick mapping influences how I create and visualize data. In my work as an artist I want to inform an audience on a specific event or concept without my inherent bias. However I realize that is impossible so in order to visualize my concept in a way that is relatable to all I would focus on how information is shared and why thats important. By doing this Ill be able to encompass a multitude of stories that share different perspectives.
