### What is the site's agenda?
The site is a NASA issued article created by the Scietific Visualization Studio branch. Overall the idea of the site is to show how space crafts collect data.

### Why does this website “speak” to you?
Anything related to space really intrigues me and how things in space defy the possiblities of what can happen on Earth. As for the design the use of motion and colors allow for really compelling visualizations. There is just enough ambiguity in the visualization to incite curiosity but enough familiarity to ground the viewer.

### How does the mapping work, and does it “work?”

### If you could change something, what would it be?
