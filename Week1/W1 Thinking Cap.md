### What is the site's agenda?
The site is a NASA issued article created by the Scietific Visualization Studio branch. Overall the idea of the site is to show how space crafts collect data.

### Why does this website “speak” to you?
Anything related to space really intrigues me and how things in space defy the possiblities of what can happen on Earth. As for the design the use of motion and colors allow for really compelling visualizations. There is just enough ambiguity in the visualization to incite curiosity but enough familiarity to ground the viewer.

### How does the mapping work, and does it “work?”
The map works as a way to show how the spacecraft collects data of carbon dioxide levels on earth. It shows the possibities and limitations of this technology. I think the visualization works really well at a macro level but not so much if the audience is looking for more specific answers.

### If you could change something, what would it be?
The visualization uses a heat map like spectrum to show the range of carbon dioxide in earths atmosphere, inorder to make this information more clear I would add a scale/key of sorts to put numerical values to the range of colors.
